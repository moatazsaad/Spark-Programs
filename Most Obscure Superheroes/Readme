This Spark program aims to identify the most obscure superheroes based on their minimal number of connections in the Marvel Graph dataset.
Overview:

The goal of this program is to analyze the Marvel Graph dataset to determine the superheroes with the fewest connections to other superheroes, making them the most obscure characters.
Setup:

To run this program, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

pip install pyspark

Instructions:

    Mount Google Drive: This program assumes the dataset is located in Google Drive. Ensure you mount your Google Drive by running the provided code.

    Load Dataset: Two files are loaded from Google Drive using PySpark's DataFrame API:
        Marvel Names.txt: Contains superhero IDs and names.
        Marvel Graph.txt: Represents connections between superheroes.

    Analyze Data:
        Calculate the number of connections for each superhero.
        Identify the minimum number of connections among all superheroes.
        Extract superheroes with the minimum number of connections.

    Display Results:
        Show the superheroes with the fewest connections, thus considered the most obscure characters.

Program Structure:

    mostobscuresuperheroes.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the program code.
    Marvel Names.txt: File containing superhero IDs and names.
    Marvel Graph.txt: File representing connections between superheroes.
